# ngx-design-system-shapa

This library is created to provide the possibility to use the color tokens from the node package
[design-system-shapa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/design-system-shapa).
Elevated pitch for [design-system-shapa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/design-system-shapa): The repository is created to bring in the colour tokens from different design system repositories available in the github space.
Ultimate idea is to provide one package where you could pick and choose which desigy system you would like to use. 
Excellent for trying out and figuring your design approach.
